# PacMan â€“ ADA Project
## Section 1, Challenge Outline. 

### 1a. Problem Summary 
This project revolves around the development of a variant of the iconic Pac-Man game, adhering closely to its traditional gameplay mechanics while emphasising the application of coding best practices throughout development. The primary objective is to create a fully functional program featuring a user interface that facilitates game initiation, gameplay, and restart options. Modifications have been introduced to the classic game design; for instance, the lateral passageways that allowed characters to move from one side of the game board to the opposite side have been sealed off. Additionally, while the original game featured four ghosts, each with their unique movement algorithms, this version simplifies their behaviour to random movements.

### 1c. Initial Plan and Design Approach.

This project adopts the Model/View/Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to structure the Pacman game. The MVC pattern aids in separating concerns, allowing for more manageable code, easier maintenance, and the flexibility to extend the game with new features. Detailed below are the roles each component plays within the game architecture and how they interact to deliver a seamless and engaging gaming experience.

#### Model
The Model component acts as the heart of the game's logic and state. It is responsible for maintaining the game's dynamic data structure and the rules that govern changes to this structure. Within the Model, key classes include:

GameBoard: Represents the game grid where Pacman and ghosts move. It is responsible for tracking the positions of all game objects, including walls, dots, power pills, and characters.
Index: Serves as an entry point for game initialisation, setting up the game board and populating it with dots, walls, and characters based on layouts.
These objects are instantiated and structured through their respective constructors during the game's initialisation phase. The Model ensures that the game state is always current, reflecting the results of player's interactions and game logic.

#### View
The View component is tasked with rendering the game state to the player. It listens for changes in the Model and updates the visual representation of the game accordingly. In this implementation, the main game loop acts as part of the View, determining which objects to draw and refresh on the screen. This includes drawing the game board, Pacman, ghosts, and updating scores and game status messages.

The separation of the View from the game logic allows for a clear distinction between how the game works and how it is presented, facilitating potential future enhancements.

#### Controller
The Controller component mediates input from the player, translating it into actions that modify the Model. It houses classes responsible for character movements, collision detection, and game state transitions. These include:

Pacman: Handles input for Pacman's movement, ensuring it follows the game rules for navigation and interactions (e.g., eating dots or power pills).
GhostMoves: Manages the ghost movements, dictating their behaviour based on the game state (e.g., chasing Pacman or fleeing when vulnerable).
Controllers modify attributes within the Model to reflect the current game state, ensuring the Model and View remain synchronised. This separation of concerns allows for the independent development and testing of game logic and player interactions.

### 1d. Tasks Breakdown.
In managing the Pacman game project, I used Trello as a central tool for task organisation. The Trello board for the project was organised into four distinct columns: "To Do", "In Progress", "In Review", and "Done!" This setup allowed for a clear and dynamic representation of the project's workflow. Each task, whether it involved initial design decisions, coding specific game features, or conducting tests, was added as a card under the appropriate column. As tasks progressed, they were moved from "To Do" to "In Progress", then "In Review" for quality checks, and finally to "Done!" upon completion. This visual progression on the Trello board not only facilitated an effective tracking mechanism but also fostered a sense of achievement as tasks visibly moved towards completion. 
Below is a screenshot of my Trello board showing some of my tasks.

### 1e. Object-oriented design.
In the development of the Pacman game, object-oriented design principles played a crucial role in structuring the program and ensuring its scalability and maintainability. By adhering to the core concepts of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, the game's architecture was both robust and flexible, facilitating the addition of new features and the modification of existing ones with minimal disruption to the overall codebase. Each game component, including Pacman, the ghosts, the game board, and other elements like power pills, was modelled as a distinct class. This approach allowed for the encapsulation of specific behaviours and properties within each class, thereby localising changes to individual components and reducing the risk of unintended side effects across the system.

The use of inheritance was particularly effective in creating a hierarchical structure for game entities, allowing shared behaviours to be defined in base classes while enabling specific variations to be implemented in derived classes. For instance, the Ghost class could be extended to create different types of ghosts with unique movement strategies, yet all could be managed through the same interface, demonstrating polymorphism. This not only streamlined the development process but also made the code more understandable and easier to debug. 

Furthermore, the design embraced the principle of separation of concerns by clearly delineating the responsibilities of each class. The GameBoard class, for example, was responsible for managing the layout and state of the game environment, while the logic for character movement and interaction was encapsulated within the Pacman and Ghost classes. This clean separation facilitated independent development and testing of components, allowing me to work on different parts of the game without conflict. Overall, the object-oriented design of the program provided a solid foundation that supported the development of an interactive game, demonstrating the power of OOP in creating structured, efficient, and adaptable software.

## Section 2, Development. 

### 2a. Adopting Best Practices.
In building the Pacman game, I made sure to follow as many best practices as I could to keep the code tidy and easy to work with. I stuck to clear naming for the variables and functions, and organised the code neatly into files and folders, which made it simple for me to understand what's going on and additionally making it easy to follow for potential contributions by others. Whenever I spotted something that could be done better, I worked to clean it up through regular refactoring, working to ensure that the code stayed clean and ready for whatever new features I wanted to add down the line.

Testing was another big part of the process. I made sure to thoroughly test each piece of the game, both on its own and when it interacts with other parts. I regularly tested the code which reassured me that everything's working as it should. These practices helped me create a Pacman game that not only plays great but also sets us up for smooth sailing in future updates and improvements.

### 2b. Reviewing Code Changes.
During the project, teaming up with my work colleague for code reviews was very helpful. We made it a point to regularly check in and go over the latest code together, using GitHub to easily highlight and discuss any bits that caught our eye. It wasn't just about looking for mistakes; these sessions were golden opportunities to swap ideas and fine-tune our approach, making sure our code was as clean and efficient as possible. Getting a fresh set of eyes on my work helped spot things I might've missed and brought new, interesting ways to tackle problems to the table. These relaxed yet productive code review meetups not only helped improve code quality but also made the whole coding journey a lot more fun and collaborative.

### 2c. Code Refactoring.
Code refactoring was a key part of the development process, ensuring that the code remained clean, efficient, and easy to maintain as the project progressed. One notable example of refactoring in the codebase involved optimising the movement logic for the characters, particularly Pacman. Initially, the movement logic was scattered across multiple methods, making it difficult to follow and prone to bugs. To improve this, I consolidated the movement logic into a single method within the Pacman class, simplifying the code and making it easier to understand. By doing so, I not only eliminated redundant code but also improved the overall performance of the game. 

### 2d. Quality Assurance. 
Using a Debugger Extension in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) improved the quality assurance process for my Pacman game project. This tool allowed me to dive deep into the code, helping me see what was happening behind the scenes as the game ran. I could pause the execution at specific points using breakpoints, which was particularly handy for tracking down bugs or understanding complex code paths. This hands-on approach to debugging helped me identify issues quickly, often saving me time that would have otherwise been spent on guesswork and manual testing.

## Section 3, Analysis. 

### 3a. Code Smells. 
In the development of the Pacman game, I encountered several "code smells" that indicated areas where the codebase could be improved. One significant smell was the presence of duplicate code across multiple functions, particularly in the logic handling the movement and collision detection for both Pacman and the ghosts. This redundancy not only made the codebase larger and more complex than necessary but also introduced the risk of inconsistencies and bugs, as any change needed to be replicated across all instances of the duplicated code.

Another code smell I identified was the "Long Method" smell, where certain functions, especially those calculating game states and rendering the game board, had grown too lengthy and complex. These oversized methods made the code difficult to read, understand, and maintain. Recognising these smells prompted me to refactor the code, breaking down long methods into smaller, more manageable ones, and abstracting common functionality into shared methods or classes. Addressing these code smells early on greatly enhanced the maintainability and readability of the code, that is more streamlined and efficient to the development process.

### 3b. Reflective Review - Improvements and Future Iterations. 
Reflecting on the development of our Pacman game, it's clear that the journey was both challenging and immensely rewarding. One of the standout achievements was being able to manage to implement the classic game mechanics with a modern twist, making it both nostalgic and fresh for today's audience. However, this process also highlighted areas for improvement. For instance, our initial approach to handling game state and character movement could have been more efficient. In future iterations, adopting more sophisticated design patterns, such as the State pattern for game states and the Strategy pattern for ghost behaviour, could enhance modularity and make the code easier to extend and maintain.

Another point for enhancement is the game's user interface and experience. While functional, the UI could be more engaging and visually appealing. Integrating more advanced graphics and animations, and perhaps even exploring web technologies like WebGL for 3D rendering, could significantly elevate the player's experience. Additionally, incorporating user feedback mechanisms within the game could provide valuable insights into player preferences and pain points, guiding future development priorities.

It's also worth noting that the current game operates under the assumption that the player already knows how to play, so a valuable enhancement would be the introduction of a popup with game instructions. This would ensure that once players understand the gameplay, they can click "Enter Game" to be presented with the game board, and then click "Start Game" to begin their adventure, making the game more accessible and user-friendly for newcomers.

Looking ahead, there are exciting opportunities to expand the game. Introducing new levels with increasing difficulty, varied maze layouts, and additional power-ups could offer players a more dynamic and engaging experience. Multiplayer functionality, allowing players to compete or cooperate in real-time, could also add a new dimension to the game. On the technical side, exploring the potential for a mobile version of the game could broaden the audience reach. Each of these improvements and expansions would not only enhance the game's appeal but also provide further opportunities to apply and deepen my software development skills, particularly in object-oriented design, user interface design, and network programming.
