PacMan â€“ ADA Project
Section 1, Challenge Outline. 

1a. Problem Summary 
This project revolves around the development of a variant of the iconic Pac-Man game, adhering closely to its traditional gameplay mechanics while emphasising the application of coding best practices throughout development. The primary objective is to create a fully functional program featuring a user interface that facilitates game initiation, gameplay, and restart options. Modifications have been introduced to the classic game design; for instance, the lateral passageways that allowed characters to move from one side of the game board to the opposite side have been sealed off. Additionally, while the original game featured four ghosts, each with their unique movement strategies, this version simplifies their behaviour to random movements, diverging from the original's complexity.
